* C-unwind and setjmp/longjmp
I heard in one chat about embedding languages into Rust that =C-unwind= just landed on
stable and it may solve a problem with these languages that use =setjmp/longjmp= and cause
undefined behaviour.

Unfortunately, no magic happened and =longjmp= over Rust stack frame will ignore unwinding
and no destructors will be called, that's certainly bad.

See =src/multiply.c= file to comment/uncomment =longjmp= line and check stdout for destructor
call, don't forget to =cargo clean= in between.
